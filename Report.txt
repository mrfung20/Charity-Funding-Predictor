Overview

The deep learning model that I constructed was developed to determine if loans given to the
different charity organizations were used effectively or not.   

Results

The target for this model will be the IS_SUCCESSFUL data.
For Features I will have the following columns worth of data:
	APPLICATION_TYPE
	AFFILIATION
	CLASSIFICATION
	USE_CASE 
	ORGANIZATION
	STATUS
	INCOME_AMT
	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
	ASK_AMOUNT
NAME and EIN were removed from the dataset as they were not the targets or features.  If I were to redo the assignment,
I would remove the status of the loan as well from the features.  

In my base model I used 8 nuerons and 5 nuerons.  My base model ended up with 43 features, so having 13 features genearally
aligned with the basic 20-25% rule.
I attempted to increase the width and length of the neural network by adding neurons and adding an additional layer.  Finally,
I attempted bucketing a 3rd categorical variable, INCOME_AMT, to see if it could improve the model's accuracy.  In the end, 
I was able to improve my initial model's accuracy metric by about 1% to ~ 73.8%, but I could not reach 75%.  

Summary

As I have previously stated, my optimization efforts did improve my model's performance, but I was unable to get to 75%.  There 
are several other approaches that could have been taken to address this problem, but a classic approach to classification 
problems is to try fitting a logistic regression model to the data to predict the outcome.  That would be the first approach I
I might try.
